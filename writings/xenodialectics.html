        <h3>Spoilers for Xenoblade 1, 2, and Torna<br></h3>
        <p>This isn't so much a formal writeup as it is a collection of disorganized and incomplete thoughts. I originally wrote this shit in like, February 2022, so there is no mention of Xenoblade 3, but obviously that game's existence affects a lot of what is said here. Regardless, I didn't want to just let this shit rot on my hard drive, so here it is I guess! I'll probably revisit this and integrate Xenoblade 3 at some point in the future. Enjoy my shitty "analysis"!</p>

        <h2>Nisan</h2>
        
        <img src="../images/angels.gif" width = 100% height = 100%

        <p>In Xenogears, there's a symbol that permeates throughout the entire work - the symbol of Nisan's church, a male and female pair of one winged angels with their arms outstretched, divine light between them. It's not complexity that makes this symbol interesting, since it's as explicit as can be - two halves that need each other to be whole. What's truly amazing about it is its thematic integration with every single aspect of the game, even down to its real life creation - the project being headed by the pair of Tetsuya Takahashi and his wife, Soraya Saga. <br> <br> Xenoblade 1 and 2 inherit the one winged angel symbolism from their progenitor - not just internally with their stories, but in their external characteristics as games. They're a pair of total opposites that are imperfect, incomplete, and worse without each other, which makes the incessant debate over which game is "better" incredibly ironic.
        That's not to say either game is exempt from criticism though, rather when people entirely disregard either one for whatever reason, they lose out on a large part of what makes these games interesting to begin with. Viewing the two as individual parts of a larger work makes <b>both</b> far more meaningful - on their own, neither is particularly special, but the interplay of characters and themes between the two games is unlike anything else. Mirroring Xenogears' one winged angels, <i>the games themselves</i> are two sides of the same coin, thesis and antithesis, with the complete message lying in the synthesis between the two. 
        </p>

        <festive><h1>Xenoblade 1</h1></festive>

        <h3>Shulk</h3>

        <p>A common point of criticism I see levied towards Xenoblade 1 quite often is directed at Shulk. People point out his seeming lack of development throughout the game, or even get mad at certain actions he takes. The scene where he spares Metal Face always gets a lot of flak, and while I agree it could have been handled better by having some actual consequences for Shulk's decision to spare him, I feel a lot of the criticism stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what Shulk's arc, and even the entire game, are about. 
        <br><br>
        
        Too often people see Shulk's arc (and by extention Xenoblade 1) as a "revenge bad" story. Shulk sets out with the goal of revenge, and by the end of it has forgiven his former enemies, so clearly that's where all the character work and themes are, right? Almost immediately after realizing that Faced Mechon are Homs, Shulk's already made up his mind that killing them is wrong. That can't be his arc, there's no change! He already held the belief that killing sentient life is wrong at the start of the game, and he keeps it at the end, even showing remorse for the inevitable killings he does cause, it's not something he has a realization of halfway through his story. Now, can you say Shulk is being incredibly naive and even stupid with his pacifism? Sure, but like it or not that's a trait the writers gave him. Either way, my point here is that Shulk, and Xenoblade 1, are not about revenge, at least not primarily. I'd go as far as to say the entire revenge story is a bit of a red herring, that most don't escape from.

        <p>
        Shulk's <b>true</b> central conflict is about freeing himself from the influence of Zanza, a character who shows up halfway through the game and really only gets his true characterization in the last 10%. That considered, it's hard to blame anyone for thinking Xenoblade 1 is a story mostly about revenge on their first playthrough, and while Shulk definitely feels some resentment towards the Mechon, on repeat playthroughs it's made explicitly clear that it comes from Zanza influencing Shulk to eliminate Mechonis for him. With a fresh perspective on a second playthrough, a lot of these revenge moments are recontextualized as Shulk battling for control from the depths of his psyche, asserting his (Shulk's) belief in the sanctity of sentient life against Zanza's bloodlust. This might seem like a weird distinction to make "oh so it was just Zanza having all the bad thoughts! Like that changes his arc at all.", but it really does drastically alter how we can interpret and understand the game's story. Zanza's really trying to use Shulk's body as a vessel to eliminate the biggest obstacle to his goal of recreation - the Mechonis. 
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Egil</h3>
        <p>
        Quick diversion here to talk about Egil, since he's the leader of Mechonis. As anyone with half a brain knows, Egil is supposed to be a tragic mirror image of Shulk, which (yawn) reflects the recurring duality symbolism once again. They both share the same goal, to stop Zanza from recreating the world. They differ in approach though - Egil believes the ends justify the means. Evil as it is, Egil's plan was the only solution that posed any possible threat to Zanza, hence why Zanza instilled these feelings of vengeance into Shulk in the hopes he'd strike Egil down for him.
        <br><br> 
        As Shulk stands over Egil ready to kill, we can outright hear the voice of Zanza - the same one that Shulk mentioned at the beginning of the game - whispering in his ear to kill Egil. I don't want to dedicate too much here to defending this game's story, but I have to comment on the criticism I've seen of this scene. I see a lot of people say that it doesn't really make sense for Egil to renounce his goal of massacring the people of Bionis through Talk no Jutsu, but again, that's really a fundamental misunderstanding of Egil - his goal is to stop Zanza's curse, not to massacre everything living on Bionis. And he doesn't renounce his means because Shulk convinces him with the power of friendship, it's the fact that Shulk has retained his sense of self against Zanza's influence! Shulk ceasing to fight Egil is an act of rebellion against Zanza's wishes, one that establishes Shulk is in control, which helps Egil realize the curse can be broken without his genocide plan. You can find the scene melodramatic, sure, but to say it isn't internally consistent is just wrong. 
        <br><br>
        You can even hear Alvis saying, in this same scene, that Shulk must “Find his own Monado!”, which triggers Shulk to recall everything he's experienced thus far. The experiences that have made him into who he is now and bonds he's forged along the way. At this point Shulk's development is essentially complete, when he's revived after Zanza's departed his body he has fully come into his own as a person, and his attainment of the True Monado in the final fight is just a physical manifestation of that will. His journey from a passive character to one with volition, not only literally allows him to become a God, but internally allows him to become the arbiter of his own life. Thus his rejection of Godhood for a simple life with the people he loves affirms his self determination. Xenoblade isn't about revenge, it's about the individuation all of us attain through interacting with others. Our constant unconscious, internal dialectic, shown through Shulk and Zanza The game's combat mechanics - changing the passage of fate, characters having their own unique “Talent Arts”, and “Chain Attacks” whose power is based off of the strength of your relationship with your party - are all masterful thematic representations of this within the gameplay.

      <festive><h1>Xenoblade 2</h1></festive>
      <h2>Blades and Drivers</h2>
      <p>
        Carrying on from the one winged angel symbols of Xenogears and the opposing Bionis and Mechonis from Xenoblade 1, Xenoblade 2 brings in the concept of Blades and Drivers for its overarching binary. Bionis and Mechonis are established as fundamental to the world of Xenoblade 1 by being the literal terrestrial foundation of it, and Blades do the same by being the core building block of Alrest's ecological system (although this fact isn't revealed to the audience until the game's end). Again, they're shown to be “two sides of the same coin” - Blades carry memetic data, whilst drivers carry genetic data - but both ultimately need each other to function properly. 
        <br>
        <video width="500"src="../video/morgana.mp4" controls loop autoplay></video>
        <br>
        If you're into Jungian psychoanalysis (or have played pretty much any JRPG), you're probably familiar with the concept of a “shadow”. If you aren't, your shadow is part of your unconscious, essentially a suppressed side of yourself that reflects your latent desires. The obvious manifestation of this concept comes in Pyra and Mythra. After the trauma inducing events of the Aegis War 500 years ago, Mythra constructed Pyra to function as her shadow. Mythra can't cook, so Pyra's a great cook. Mythra's prickly and temperamental, so Pyra's overly kind and calm. This much is pretty obvious to anyone who's played the game, but the concept of a shadow is applicable in more than just the Aegis' character. 
        <br><br>
        Blades <i>in general</i> function as an embodiment of their Driver's shadows. For example, Nia's lack of trust and longing for a place to belong is embodied in Dromarch's devotion and loyalty, and Morag's restrained masculinity is contrasted by Brighid's outward femininity. Blade and Driver thus represent two opposite halves that create something greater than themselves when combined, a dope allegory to portray the theme that our bonds are what make us stronger, not in spite of, but because of our distinct characteristics. (I am noticing a trend) Only by working together can Drivers and Blades reach their full potential, something that's eloquently reflected in the game's combat with Fusion Combos and the affinity system.
        <br><br>
        It's important to note that everyone in the party utilizes Blades and Drivers in their intended manner, even Nia and Zeke, who are Flesh or Blade Eaters respectively and could easily just fight on their own instead choose to fight as Driver and Blade out of their own volition. This stands in stark contrast with all the major antagonists of the story, who reject the polar pairs of Driver and Blade to instead seek an all encompassing monistic power by utilizing their own -Eater weapons (beyond the opening few chapters of the game at least). Representing the difference in ideology between the party and Torna regarding duality subtly but effectively.
        <br><br>
        This concept of dual opposites changing each other through their interactions is shown in the character's arcs as well. I don't want to take the obvious example of Pyra and Mythra, as it's been talked about to death, so take Zeke and Morag for example - at the start of the game these two characters couldn't be more different from each other, at least externally. Zeke is putting up a front of a zany and wacky chuuni to cope with the fact that he's become disillusioned with life, and Morag's a stoic general hiding her true feelings behind the mask of “duty”. By the end of the game though, both have dropped their external personas, at least a little bit, and changed on their journey through interacting with each other and people different than them. Zeke's become a more serious mentor figure to Rex, and Morag's more open about her sensibilities and even cracks jokes. They've become "whole", through accepting their own dualistic nature, not rejecting it.
      </p>
      <h3>Rex</h3>
      <p>
        Starting this section off with a criticism like I did with Shulk, since it's a good topic to bounce off of into further discussion. Lots of people complain about Rex being too static, or even boring as a protagonist, and when I first beat the game I  agreed with them. Rex is static, but his staticity isn't really a flaw. Rex catalyzes change in everyone around him - Mythra, Nia, Malos, Jin, Zeke - every single major character really. It's also important to remember that Xenoblade 2 is as much Mythra's story as it is Rex's. Obviously he's not the deepest character of all time, but does he really need to be? And despite all his supposed lack of change, he does undergo major development throughout the story, albeit more subtly than Shulk's wild fluctuations. He tempers his idealism, learns how to truly love others, and constantly challenges his relationship with power.
        <br><br>
        At the start of the game, Rex is already relatively wise. This is a 15 year old kid who works hard and makes good money to voluntarily send the majority of it back to his hometown. He's lost both of his parents and never once sulks or complains about it, he takes it in stride. Not to say he's without flaws though, he's still an archetypal shonen hero who throws himself into danger to solve everything on his own. He's a bit naive, thinking he can live without being involved in conflict at all. A lot of his flaws are reflected in Pyra and Mythra as well - his brashness is contrasted against Pyra's timidity and his impulsive nature with Mythra's methodical thought process.
        <br><br>
        In fact, his relationship with Pyra and Mythra (Referring to them interchangeably from now on for hte sake of simplicity) serves as a benchmark for his development throughout the game. Or rather, his thought process and beliefs manifest through his relationship with them. In the early chapters, Rex doesn't want anything to do with conflict of any kind - he just wants to get to Elysium. This changes in Chapter 3, where Vandham explains to him that it's naive to think you aren't involved in a war one way or another. Vandham continues to mentor Rex throughout the chapter, and later tells him that war isn't about right or wrong, only power, and being afraid to use power can only lead to failure.
        <br><br> 
        His words call back to the events of Torna, where Addam failed in his journey to subdue Malos as a result of his fear of the Aegis' power. He does make efforts to connect with her, but ultimately Addam treats Mythra as a ticking bomb of mass destruction, which makes him unable to awaken Pneuma, and ultimately causes the sinking of Torna. Naturally, Mythra starts to see herself as a weapon of mass destruction afterwards. Rex, however, sees the Aegis' power in the complete opposite way from Addam and Mythra - he sees it as the power to protect. But, that still isn't quite right. 
        <br><br>
        After Vandham's death, Rex realizes conflict is unavoidable, and so he starts fighting, and using the Aegis' power to do what he thinks it's made to - protect his friends. This doesn't really work out for him though, he winds up losing Pyra, at Tantal and is once again lost and searching for answers. In Chapter 7, after going through Spirit Crucible Elpys, he meets with Addam and has another crucial conversation. Addam questions him as to why he wants power, and his response is a natural one - to protect. Addam reprimands him for this, “There is a limit to what one man can do” after all. He explains Mythra's fear of her own power, and finally admits his own shortcoming from his fear of her power.
        </p>
        
        <img src="../images/malos.gif" width = 100% height = 100%
        style="float: right; width: auto; height: 250px; margin-right: 1em; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"/>
        <p>
        It's here where Rex realizes that the Aegis' power isn't to protect, it's him who has to protect her - physically, and emotionally. Thus his answer changes, and he displays his increased maturity by no longer charging headfirst into the next confrontation with Malos and Jin - he isn't fighting for his friends anymore, he's fighting for the Aegis.
        <br><br>
        All of this development and thematic buildup finally culminates in the final battle against Malos. At this point, Malos has stopped being and seeing himself as “a guy whose sole purpose is to destroy”, and becomes a trial humanity must overcome to justify their existence. “If that's all you got, humanity's never gonna chang!” Either he defeats Rex and company and proves humanity was never worth saving, or the party defeats him and catalyzes change - either way Malos receives a favorable outcome. The winner will be decided solely by power and sheer will.
        <br><br>
        It's here where Rex finally gives his true answer to the question he's been asked throughout his journey as well. “'Why are you doing all this?'' I'm doing it for myself! If it makes people happy, puts smiles on their faces, that's my role in this world!” Rex finally has the strength to admit he's fighting for himself, and later on has to come to terms with the fact that he can't do everything himself - by letting Pneuma go be the hero instead. He's finally, truly, “fighting his own war”.
        <br><br> 
        And that's what really resonates with me about Rex - he's not particularly deep, but his arc is really about him learning to disconnect himself from his friends, and learn to fight for himself instead, a theme that isn't all too common in fiction. It's his philosophy that separates his success from Addam's failure, his optimism and desire for change from Malos' pessimism and want for stagnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is Xenoblade 2 at its core? Well, this is kind of a nonanswer, but it's a lot of different things. It's an allegory for Plato's cave, a cliche story about the power of friendship, and a simple tale of how a boy met a girl. But at the very heart of the work, what I believe Takahashi and Monolith Soft were really making with Xenoblade 2, is <b>an absolute and total inversion of the game that came before it. </b>
        </p>
        <div class="quote">

        <festive><h1>Dr. Klaus or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Trinity Processor </h1></festive>
        <p>
            Despite his limited screen time in both games, Klaus is one of the most interesting and important characters in the series. The original Klaus, before the “reset” reflects all the major antagonists in the series - he's quite literally detached from his fellow man, he's in a space orbit station where all he can do is gaze upon humanity on the macrocosmic scale, as many scientists do. He sees nothing but the macrocosm of humanity's stagnation, and so he despairs. He uses the Trinity Processor to “birth a universe”, and hopefully “move mankind one step closer to the divine”. And thus, his body and consciousness is split in 2 halves. The half sent to the world of XB1 is vindicated by the success of his experiment and becomes the egomaniacal Zanza, whereas the half that remains in XB2 is humbled and overcome with guilt at the failure of the experiment and seeks atonement.
            <br><br>
            Something commonly pointed out is the difference in presentation of Klaus's experiment between Xenoblade 1 and 2. In Xenoblade 1, Klaus is portrayed as a sort of crazed scientist, whereas in Xenoblade 2 he's much more sympathetic and added context allows us to understand his perspective more. This is a clear retcon, I can't really dispute that fact, but I'm going to extrapolate a bit and say that the fact that Monolith didn't change the scene in Definitive Edition to match 2's version means that keeping these two scenes different in tone is intentional. Assuming so, the difference in portrayal between the two does a great job at emphasizing the running theme of differing perspectives, and further establishing Klaus's schismatic nature. 
            <br><br>
            What's really interesting though, is that even the Architect isn't <i>truly</i> “benevolent”. Even after his destruction of the planet, he continues to keep his macrocosmic view of humanity - once rebuilding it and seeing the world has turned out exactly the same as before, he's kind of disappointed and takes a backseat. It's only when he's presented with the microcosmic good - Rex and his party, that he starts to question his original thought process. 
            <br><br>
            The Architect and Zanza are two sides of the same person, Klaus. You could say the Architect is an embodiment of Klaus's superego, while Zanza is his id/shadow. Klaus's character represents the inherently dualistic nature of man, and is also symbolic of the rift between the two dimensions.
